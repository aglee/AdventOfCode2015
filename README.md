# Advent of Code 2015

<http://adventofcode.com/2015>

I found Advent of Code 2016 thoroughly addictive.  When that was done I started on 2015 so I could keep feeding the addiction.

My original plan was to do it entirely in Python.  I did the last few with a combination of Java and Swift, since I wanted practice in those languages.  I couldn't get a solution for Day 19 Part 2 to work, so I brute-forced it by hand.  Might revisit it someday and rectify that loose end.
